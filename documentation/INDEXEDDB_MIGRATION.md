# IndexedDB Migration for League Standings

## Overview
Migrated from localStorage to IndexedDB to support unlimited weeks per league (30+ weeks).

## Why IndexedDB?

### localStorage Limitations:
- **Size**: 5-10MB total across all data
- **Issue**: With 5 leagues √ó 30 weeks √ó ~500KB per PDF = ~75MB needed ‚ùå

### IndexedDB Benefits:
- **Size**: 50MB+ guaranteed, can request hundreds of MB
- **Performance**: Better for large binary data
- **Reliability**: Proper database with transactions
- **Scalability**: Can handle 30+ weeks per league easily ‚úÖ

## Storage Capacity

**Previous (localStorage):**
- ~5-10MB total
- Enough for ~10-20 PDFs max

**Current (IndexedDB):**
- 50MB+ guaranteed minimum
- Can store 100+ PDFs easily
- Auto-requests more storage if needed

## Implementation Details

### Database Structure
- **Database Name**: `StrikersStandingsDB`
- **Version**: 1

### Object Stores:

1. **pdfs** - Stores PDF files
   - Key: `{league}_{week}` (e.g., "Monday Night Open_Week 1")
   - Fields:
     - `id`: Primary key
     - `league`: League name
     - `week`: Week label
     - `fileName`: Original filename
     - `pdfData`: Base64 encoded PDF
     - `uploadDate`: ISO timestamp

2. **weeks** - Stores week metadata per league
   - Key: `league` name
   - Fields:
     - `league`: Primary key (league name)
     - `weeks`: Array of week objects
       - `week`: Week label
       - `fileName`: PDF filename
       - `uploadDate`: ISO timestamp

### Migration Process
- Automatic on first load after update
- Moves data from `localStorage` ‚Üí `IndexedDB`
- Cleans up old localStorage entries
- Sets `migrated_to_indexeddb` flag

## File Size Limits
- **Recommended**: < 10MB per PDF
- **Reason**: Browser performance and storage quotas
- Most standings PDFs: 200KB - 2MB (plenty of room!)

## Admin Panel Features

### New Features:
1. **Storage Usage Display**
   - Shows: Used MB / Total MB
   - Shows: Percentage used
   - Color coded: Blue (normal), Red (>80%)

2. **Week Management**
   - Text input for week labels (flexible naming)
   - Upload multiple PDFs per league
   - Preview/Remove individual weeks
   - Natural sorting (Week 1, Week 2, etc.)

3. **Clear All Data**
   - Emergency cleanup button
   - Double confirmation
   - Removes all PDFs and metadata

### User Interface:
```
Storage Used: 12.5 MB / 100 MB (12.5%)
