# Security Fix: Removed Exposed API Keys

## What Was Wrong

Previously, the app used `VITE_AIRTABLE_API_KEY` and `VITE_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` which were exposed in the browser. Anyone could open DevTools and extract your API credentials.

## What We Fixed

✅ **Created secure API route:** `/api/leagues/list`  
✅ **Updated league service** to use the API route instead of direct Airtable calls  
✅ **Removed VITE_ dependencies** - no more exposed credentials  
✅ **Maintained caching** - still fast and efficient  

## New Architecture

```
Before (Insecure ❌):
Browser → Airtable API
    ↑
  API Key visible in DevTools!

After (Secure ✅):
Browser → /api/leagues/list → Airtable API
              ↑                    ↑
          No API key         API key on server
```

## Files Changed

1. **Created:** `/api/leagues/list.js`
   - Secure serverless function
   - Fetches leagues server-side
   - Returns clean JSON to browser

2. **Updated:** `/src/services/leagueService.js`
   - Now calls `/api/leagues/list` instead of Airtable directly
   - No more exposed API keys
   - Same caching behavior

3. **Updated:** Documentation files to reflect new security model

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Set Vercel Environment Variables

**Only these server-side variables (NO VITE_ prefix):**

```
AIRTABLE_API_KEY = your_key
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID = your_base_id
```

Plus your existing Zapier webhooks (already set).

### 2. Deploy

Push to GitHub or redeploy in Vercel. The app will now:
- ✅ Keep API keys secure on server
- ✅ Fetch leagues through API route
- ✅ Cache results for performance
- ✅ Work exactly the same from user perspective

## Testing

After deployment:

1. **Open DevTools → Network tab**
2. **Navigate to /leagues page**
3. **Look for:** `GET /api/leagues/list` (not Airtable URL)
4. **Verify:** No API keys visible in browser

## Benefits

- 🔒 **Secure:** API keys never exposed to browser
- 🚀 **Fast:** Maintains caching behavior
- 🛡️ **Protected:** Can add rate limiting later
- 📊 **Controlled:** Server-side logging and monitoring
- 🔐 **Scalable:** Easy to add authentication if needed

## Local Development

Your local `.env.local` should have (no VITE_ prefix):

```env
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=keyXXXXXXXX
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=appXXXXXXXX
```

The dev server will use these for the API routes.

## Summary

**Before:** API keys exposed in browser ❌  
**After:** API keys secure on server ✅  
**User Experience:** Exactly the same ✨  
**Security:** Significantly improved 🔒
