## Data Flow

```
Admin Actions:
1. Admin adds/edits league in admin-leagues.html
2. League saved to IndexedDB
3. All pages automatically show updated leagues

User Experience:
1. User visits website
2. FeaturesSection loads active leagues
3. League cards render with current data
4. User clicks "Sign Up"
5. Modal shows current active leagues
6. User clicks "Standings"
7. Modal shows current active leagues
```

## How It Works

### On Page Load:
```javascript
// All components do this:
useEffect(() => {
  const loadLeagues = async () => {
    const allLeagues = await getAllLeagues();
    const activeLeagues = allLeagues.filter(l => l.active);
    setLeagues(activeLeagues);
  };
  loadLeagues();
}, []);
```

### Automatic Updates:
- Admin adds "Summer League" â†’ Appears on website immediately
- Admin deactivates "Church League" â†’ Hidden from website
- Admin edits league time â†’ Updated on all pages
- No page refresh needed (close and reopen modal)

## Database Schema

  name: "Monday Night Open",  // Displayed everywhere
  day: "Monday",              // Used in cards & dropdown
  time: "7:00 PM",            // Used in cards & dropdown
  format: "Open",             // Determines emoji & display
  totalWeeks: 30,             // Shown as "30 weeks"
  description: "Open to all", // Shown in card
  active: true                // Controls visibility
}
```
